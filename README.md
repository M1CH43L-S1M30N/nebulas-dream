Welcome to Nebula's Dream. This is the HTML canvas game that I developed using JavaScript. The game itself is completely original, with inspiration taken from the classic game Oregon Trail. The objective is to travel to make the journey to a new planet, while dealing with unexpected obstacles. If you make it without all of your passengers going insane, you win.
